I tend to spend quite a bit of my time on a command line, so I am always looking for little ways to make my life easier. Because of that, this post will be a bit of a living document that I plan to occasionally update as I discover more handy tricks. This is not a comprehensive list, nor is it intended to be one. These are shortcuts that allow me to have a smoother workflow.

**Note:** The ^ is shorthand notation for Ctrl, or the Control Key. If a capital letter is specified that means you need to hold down Shift as well. For example, the hotkey '^C' means you would hold down Ctrl + Shift + c.

Bash Hotkeys
---

|^C	 | Copy |
|^V	 | Paste |
|^a	 | Go to the beginning of the line. |
|^e	 | Go to the end of the line. |
|^l	 | Clear the Screen. |
|^w	 | Delete the word before the cursor. |
|^u	 | Clears the line before the cursor position. |
|^k	 | Clear the line after the cursor. |
|^d	 | Exit the current shell. |
|^z	 | Suspend current process; fg restores it. |
|^c	 | Kill current process (sends the SIGINT signal). |
|^t	 | Swap the last two characters before the cursor. |
|Esc + t | Swap the last two words before the cursor. |
|Alt + f | Move cursor forward one word on the current line. |
|Alt + b | Move cursor backward one word on the current line. |
|Tab	 | Auto-complete files,folder names, and command names. |

Bash History
---

|!!       | Run the last command again; this can be useful when combined with command substitution, e.g. `for i in $(!!); do STUFF; done` |
|!keyword | Reruns the last command starting with keyword. For example, if the last command I ran starting with 'ser' was `service sshd restart`, `!ser` would run that command. |
|!#       | Where # is the number that corresponds to that command in history. |
|!$       | Final argument of the previous command. |
|!^       | First argument of the previous command. |
|Esc + .  | Final argument of the previous command; hitting 'Esc + .' multiple times will cycle through the last argument history. |
|^r       | Search through previously used commands. |

Special Bash Variables
---

|$$ | PID of the current shell. |
|$! | PID of the last job run in the background. |
|$_ | Final argument of the previous command. |
|$? | Exit status of the previous command. |

SSH Sessions
---

|~.  | Terminate SSH session; ideal for hung sessions. |
|~^z | Suspend the SSH session; type fg to resume it. |
|~?  | Display the supported escape sequences. |

**Note:** SSH escape sequences are only valid after a new line.
