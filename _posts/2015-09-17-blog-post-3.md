An often underused feature of OpenSSH is the Match statement. Match statements work on OpenSSH 4.4+; applicable versions ship with RHEL/CentOS 6+ and Ubuntu 12.04+. The Match directive accepts the following options:

* Match User
* Match Group
* Match Host
* Match LocalAddress
* Match LocalPort
* Match Address

Match statements can be used to help harden SSH but can easily become complicated when options like `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` are in use as Match does not accept these parameters. If your goal is to allow root to login from certain IPs, then you can disable root via the `PermitRootLogin` option and add root with either `AllowsUsers` or `AllowGroups` options (`PermitRootLogin` supersedes the other options regardless of position). After that you can explicitly allow root login from a Match block:

```
Match Address 127.0.0.1,192.168.0.12
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

**Note:** Match blocks do not end until they reach the end of the file *or* hit another Match block.
