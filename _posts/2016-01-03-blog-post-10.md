When parsing log files sed is not the go-to tool for most techs, but it offers a pretty neat feature: the ability to easily search a log file for a specific date/time range.

Pattern Matching
---

```
sed -n '/Dec 30 13:00/p' /var/log/messages
```

Date Range Matching
---

```
sed -n '/Dec 30 13:00/,/Dec 30 14:00/p' /var/log/messages
```

Change Delimiters
===

If your search term contains the character `/`, you can change the delimiter used by sed:

```
sed -n '\|30/Dec/2015:21|,\|30/Dec/2015:23|p' /var/log/httpd/access.log
```

Command Break Down
---

`-n`
This flag tells sed to suppress all output except for matching lines.

`/Dec 30 13:00/`
Match lines containing the string "Dec 30 13:00". The search term can be a regular expression, /regexp/.

`/Dec 30 13:00/,/Dec 30 14:00/`
Match all content from the first "Dec 30 13:00" to the first "Dec 30 14:00".

`p`
Print the current pattern space.

`\|`
Change the delimiter to `|`. The `|` can be any character.
