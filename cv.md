## Resumes should be Nerdy!

Years ago I stumbled onto Major Hayden's [man-page resume](https://github.com/major/resume/blob/gh-pages/resume.ronn) and have been in love with it ever since. His resume is in the form of a Linux man page; to paraphrase, a nerdy person ought to have a nerdy resume.

This has stuck with me for years and I wanted to have a similarly nerdy resume without just straight-up copying his idea. Recently I had the idea that a DevOps centric person ought to have a DevOps resume, so that's what I set out to do!

In order to fulfil my goal, the resume must adhere to the following:

* Be well documented!
* Produce a web friendly resume.
* Produce a PDF resume for distribution.
* Have a single source of truth.
    * This means that the content **must be** separate from the format.
* Have a pipeline to automatically publish the various forms of my resume.
* Support the [Konami code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code).
  * I honestly have no idea why this is a criteria, it just feels like the right things to do.
